# Twitter Automation Project

This is a Python script that uses Selenium to automate tweeting on Twitter. It opens a Chrome browser, logs in to a Twitter account, and sends a tweet with a predefined message.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Selenium library (install using `pip install selenium`)
- Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome browser version)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-automation.git
   cd twitter-automation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. Download ChromeDriver and place it in the project directory. Make sure it matches your Chrome browser version. You can download ChromeDriver from the [official website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

## Usage

1. Open the `twitter_automation.py` file in a text editor.

2. Replace the placeholders `'username'` and `'password'` with your Twitter account credentials:

   ```python
   username.send_keys("your-username")
   password.send_keys("your-password")
   ```

3. Modify the `tweet` variable to customize the message you want to tweet:

   ```python
   tweet = "Hello Everyone! This is a tweet..."
   ```

4. Save the file.

5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python twitter_automation.py
   ```

   The script will open a Chrome browser, log in to your Twitter account, and send the tweet with the specified message.

**Note:** For security reasons, it's recommended to store your Twitter credentials in a separate configuration file and import them into the script instead of hardcoding them directly.
